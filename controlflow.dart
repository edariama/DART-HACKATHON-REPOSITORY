// ## Program 3: Determine Grade Based on Marks
// Write a Dart program to determine the grade based on a student's marks. The program should print out the appropriate grade according to the following criteria:
// - If the marks are greater than 85, print "Excellent".
// - If the marks are between 75 and 85 (inclusive), print "Very Good".
// - If the marks are between 65 and 75 (inclusive), print "Good".
// - If the marks are below 65, print "Average".


void main() {
  // Define the student's marks
  int marks = 78;

  // Determine the grade based on the marks
  String grade;
  if (marks > 85) {
    grade = "Excellent";
  } else if (marks >= 75 && marks <= 85) {
    grade = "Very Good";
  } else if (marks >= 65 && marks < 75) {
    grade = "Good";
  } else {
    grade = "Average";
  }

  // Print the grade
  print("Grade: $grade");
}
